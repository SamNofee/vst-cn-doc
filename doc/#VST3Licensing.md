## SteinbergVST使用指南

Whenever **VST**® is used or the SDK has been used to create a product or the SDK is included (Open-source [GPLv3 ](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)case), it is required to add the reference to [Steinberg](http://www.steinberg.net/) by using the **VST compatible logo** as supplied by [Steinberg](http://www.steinberg.net/). Included in the VST SDK, the **VST compatible logo** can be found in the folder *VST_SDK/VST3_SDK/vst3_doc/artwork*.


This logo exists in different forms: with and without the trademark text, black on white and white on black. If you choose the logo without the trademark text, you have to include the following statement somewhere:





**1. Required use of VST Compatible logo**

Whenever “**VST**” is used, or the SDK is used to create a product, or when the SDK is included, it is required to add the reference to Steinberg by using the “**VST Compatible logo**” as supplied by Steinberg on each of the following:

a) on package

b) on website:

The **VST Compatible logo** must be shown on every webpage that relates to such a product or shows **VST**. Using e.g. only within the imprint is NOT sufficient.

c) all documentation, regardless of the media used, such as PDF manuals, website, printed manuals etc.


On each of the following the logo can be omitted only if not enough space is available. However, in such a case be sure to include Steinberg's copyrights notice:

a) on all advertising materials

b) in the "about box" or similar (e.g. help menu, startup screen) of the product.



**2. Use of VST unrelated to the VST Compatible logo**

It is allowed for all parties that have entered into the current Steinberg **VST** Plug-in SDK Licensing Agreement to use “**VST**” in regular letters to refer to compatibility as long as complying with the Agreement. This can be done on the package/website or even within the name of the product as long as the form of use is in line with the Agreement and the **VST Compatible logo** is always shown in the context of such. The following shall provide more guidance related to common forms of usage.



**3. Use when claiming compatibility**

It is allowed to use claims such as “**compatible with 64-bit VST**” if the **VST Compatible logo** is placed in context of such claim, e.g. not too far away on the same page, and the product uses or has been created using the SDK and is, in fact, compatible.



**4. Use on website**

It is not sufficient to include the **VST Compatible logo** only in the imprint or one other page. All pages that relate to a product using or created using the SDK or showing **VST** must show the **VST Compatible logo**.



**5. Use on package**

The **VST Compatible logo** must be printed on the package of any product using or created using the SDK or showing **VST**.



**6. Use in product name or logo**

Provided that the **VST Compatible logo** is always displayed in the context of such a product name, “**VST**” may be added to the basic product name, e.g. like “mycoolEngine for **VST**”, if set in regular type and not graphically illustrated or integrated into the product name, and if the **VST Compatible logo** is always shown in direct context to such a product name. It is not allowed to merge the basic product name and **VST** in any graphical way into one integrated visual. E.g., it is allowed to use like this:

![MycoolEngine_Ok](IMAGE\MycoolEngine_Ok.png)

下面这种用法是不被接受的:

![MycoolEngine_Not_Ok](IMAGE\MycoolEngine_Not_Ok.png)



**7. 在公司名词上**

VST不能被用在公司名称上



**8. 在社交媒体上使用**

It is allowed to use **VST** in channels and their names/URLs and the like, if a junction is used to denote the compatibility, e.g. in “MycoolEngineForVST”, and if the channels etc. always show the **VST Compatible logo**.



**9. 在域名上使用**

It is allowed to use **VST** in domains, e.g. second level domains, if a junction is used to denote the compatibility, e.g. in “[MycoolEngineForVST.com](http://mycoolengineforvst.com/)”, and if any page under such domain shows the **VST Compatible logo** and the domain only shows products using or created using the SDK.

**10. 在logo上使用**

公司名称中包含VST是不被允许的，但用在VST产品上是允许的，参考第六条



**11. 在影视作品中使用**

It is allowed to use “**VST**” in the title of a video or in a video, e.g. a tutorial, in a way as named above, e.g. as an addition to a product name or to show the compatibility, if the **VST Compatible logo** is shown in the video and, if **VST** is included in the title of the video, on any page that shows the video and/or the title. Provided that a frame of the video is shown as still (e.g. when presenting the video while not playing it) and such frame includes **VST**, the frame or the direct context of the video needs to show the **VST Compatible logo**.



**12. 在目录中使用**

It is allowed to use **VST** in a category or in a related URL outside of the domain, e.g. in [www.myreviews.com/VSTplugins/](http://www.myreviews.com/VSTplugins/), if such category is of generic meaning, and if under such category only forms of use and/or products in line with the SDK agreement are listed.



**13. 在组合中使用**

诸如“VSTi”的名称组合是不被允许的



**14. VST兼容LOGO**

当前与**VST兼容的LOGO**如下所示：

![VST_Compatible_Logo_Steinberg_with_TM](IMAGE\VST_Compatible_Logo_Steinberg_with_TM.png)

![VST_Compatible_Logo_Steinberg_with_TM_negative](IMAGE\VST_Compatible_Logo_Steinberg_with_TM_negative.png)

最小打印尺寸：20 x 18,7 mm

![VST_Compatible_Logo_Steinberg](IMAGE\VST_Compatible_Logo_Steinberg.png)

![VST_Compatible_Logo_Steinberg_negative](IMAGE\VST_Compatible_Logo_Steinberg_negative.png)

最小打印尺寸：15 x 10 mm 



**15. VST商标使用的一般准则**

On product documentation and promotional materials, use the registered trademark symbol (®) the first time the VST trademark appears in the text. Also include an attribution of Steinberg's ownership within the credit notice.
Attribution: 

> **"VST® is a trademark of Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH, registered in Europe and other countries."**

**VST2是什么**

The "Proprietary Steinberg VST 2" license, which is the VST 2 license agreement, allows you to distribute your VST 2 plug-in/host in a binary form. However, please note the following requirements:

- You need written permission from Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH in order to distribute your VST 2 plug-in/host (which had to be done before October 2018).
- You need to mention ***Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH*** in the about box and/or documentation of your VST 2 plug-in/host and follow the [Steinberg VST usage guidelines](https://developer.steinberg.help/display/VST/Steinberg+VST+usage+guidelines).
- Note that the "Proprietary Steinberg VST 3" license does not include the "Proprietary Steinberg VST 2" license, you have to sign it separately! It was available in the VST 2 SDK and in the VST 3 SDK old version.
- Note that from the first of October 2018, Steinberg **does not accept any more submissions of license agreement for VST 2** plug-in/host! This means:

> If you do not have a license agreement signed with Steinberg before October 2018, you are not allowed to distribute VST 2 plug-ins or VST 2 hosts!

**9. Do I have to sign and send to Steinberg the "Proprietary Steinberg VST 3" license agreement for each new version of the VST 3 SDK?**

- No, the license agreement has its own versioning, you just have to be sure that you have already signed the correct version of it.
- As of SDK version 3.6.8, the license has the version 2.0 (only some minor change/formatting of the text of the license agreement were done in the last SDK versions [3.6.9 up to 3.7.1])
  - **If** you use a **VST 3 SDK version >= 3.6.8**, you have to be sure that you sent Steinberg a signed license agreement (**version 2.x**) from one of the last VST 3 SDKs (>= 3.6.8).
  - **If** you use a **VST 3 SDK version < 3.6.8**, you have to be sure that you sent Steinberg a signed license agreement (**version 1**) included in the VST 3 SDK that you use.
  - If you do not know if you already sent it, it is recommended to send it again and in this case it is possible to use the license agreement of the **last VST 3 SDK** too!
  - If you have signed a license agreement (**version 2.x**) and a new released **VST 3 SDK** uses a new license agreement (**version 3.x**), then you have to signed it again.
- The previous explanation also applies to used 3rd parties SDK like JUCE/iPlug/SynthEdit... just check which VST 3 SDK version is used by the 3rd party SDK you work with and sign the correct license agreement or the last available one.



**10. I would like to share the source code of my VST 2 plug-in/host on GitHub or other web-based exchange platform.**

- It is allowed but be sure that you do NOT include the Steinberg VST 2 files: like *aeffect.h* and *aeffectx.h*. These files are under a different license which does not allow redistribution!



**11. I am a developer/company and I want to develop and distribute a VST 2 plug-in and/or host in binary form.**

- If you have signed the VST 2 license agreement (before October 2018), you can.
- If not, you are not allowed to distribute it!
